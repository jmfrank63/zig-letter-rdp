# Letter RDP (Zig Implementation)

## Overview

This repository contains the Zig implementation of the Letter Recursive Descent Parser (RDP), based
on the original Node.js version of the Udemy course Building a parser from scratch. It demonstrates
the implementation of a recursive descent parser in Zig. It is also used to learn Zig, thus some
sub-optimal code may be present.
